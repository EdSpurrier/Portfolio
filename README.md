# Portfolio Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Portfolio Project, a microfrontend-based application designed to showcase a modular approach to web development. This project is structured using Git submodules, allowing each segment of the application to be developed and maintained independently.

## Modules

The project is divided into several key modules:

1. **Navigation:** The module responsible for the navigation aspects of the application.
2. **Host:** The main hosting module that integrates all microfrontends.
3. **Utils/Tools:** A collection of development tools and utilities to aid in the development process.
